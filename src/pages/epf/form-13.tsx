        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What Are the Benefits of EPF Transfer?</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
          When an employee changes jobs, it is advisable to transfer the existing provident fund (PF) balance to the new PF account established by their current employer. 
          Transferring the PF balance rather than withdrawing it offers several advantages, which are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 text-gray-700">
          <li>If a PF amount is withdrawn within five years of joining, Tax Deducted at Source (TDS) is applicable. However, transferring the corpus within this period allows for a tax-free transition.</li>
          <li>The EPFO offers compound interest on PF contributions. By opting for a transfer instead of a withdrawal, employees can ensure that their interest earnings are maximised over time.</li>
        </ul>

          Overall, EPF transfer form 13 simplifies the process of transferring your PF account. By following the online process mentioned above, 
          you can quickly initiate and track your transfer without hassle. Make sure your UAN, e-KYC and employer details are updated to avoid delays.
