          EPF Form 10C is a crucial document that allows EPF members to claim their employer's contribution to the 
          Employee Pension Scheme (EPS). Employers contribute 8.33% of the 12% EPF contribution to EPS, with the 
          remaining amount going to the EPF. By using Form 10C, you can withdraw the employer's share of the 
          contribution under specific circumstances. Learn more about Form 10C here to understand the eligibility 
          criteria and the procedure for usage.

        <p className="text-gray-700">
          The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is a crucial retirement savings scheme that includes contributions from 
          both employees and employers. The employer's contribution is divided into two components: the EPF (Employee 
          Provident Fund) and the EPS (Employee Pension Scheme). If you wish to withdraw funds from your EPS account, 
          where your employer contributes towards your pension, you will need to submit EPF Form 10C. This form is 
          essential for accessing the pension funds accumulated under the EPS.
