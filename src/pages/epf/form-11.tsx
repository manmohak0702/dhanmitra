          The Employee Provident Fund (EPF) is a scheme that helps employees save funds for their post-retirement life. 
          Both employers and employees make a contribution of 12% of an employee's basic salary to the EPF account.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
          While recruiting a new employee, employers verify their previous EPF membership status. A self-declaration form 
          named EPF Form 11 is used to check whether an employee is a part of the EPF scheme or not. This guide will walk 
          you through how to fill out and submit EPF Form 11.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Purpose of EPF Form 11</h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          EPF Form 11 allows employees to show their EP status when they join a new company that offers the EPF scheme. 
          This form helps to check whether he/she is not a member of the Employee Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). 
          The company or the employer has to continue his/her PF obligations if the employee is already a member of EPFO.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
          An employee must fill out the form before joining a new organisation. This form is needed while transferring PF accounts. 
          You can also create multiple EPF accounts if you link your Universal Account Number (UAN) details with your new organisation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
          A new employee can also opt not to contribute to EPF or EPS. This can happen in situations if the new employee was not a 
          member of EPFO while working in his or her previous organisation or has not worked before and receives a monthly salary 
          of more than â‚¹15,000 from the new organisation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 mt-3">
          Such employees are known as excluded employees. Members who receive PF pensions or those who have withdrawn their PF 
          previously also come under excluded employees.
